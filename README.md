In the following html file we have attached the styles inside the style tag and Javascript code inside script tag.
This is one of the coolest handy example to develop an interactive responsive progress header for any web page.
To make it more cooler I have added separate colors for each header options on selection. 

Download the project and simply run the html on any browser. Feel free to add your uniqueness to it.
Thank you!
